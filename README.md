## About

This repository now includes a lessons in `app/`. Each lesson is a self-contained folder with a `README.md` explaining the objective, steps, expected outcomes, and recovery notes.

This repository is for learners who want to move beyond using Angular and toward truly understanding it. Lessons are intentionally short, reproducible, and designed for experimentation in disposable repositories.

Who this is for:

- New developers learning Angular from scratch
- Experienced developers wanting to solidify their Angular knowledge
- Developers who use Angular but want to understand its internals
- Educators looking for compact, example-driven exercises

## Goals

- Build deep, practical Angular knowledge through hands-on exercises
- Encourage experimentation and learning by doing

## How to use this repo

1. Clone this repository locally.
2. Follow the instructions in each lesson's `README.md`.
